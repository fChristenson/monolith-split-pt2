# How to split a monolith pt2

## What we will cover

Elaborate on pt1

## Notes

Question:

> Thank you Fredrik, it took me few days to watch the video. The list of questions is a great help when not knowing where to start, is this the main job of what we call an architect to decide those splits an have a "long term" vision of the splits and interactions ? (EDIT: You answered it in the last minutes of the video,) On the split part few questions : how do you deal with synchronising the data models between services that are splitted, is it an indicator that the split might be wrong if too much models are shared, an indicator of dependencies ? If I understand well, splitting taking into account how the business is already splitted (if it is) could be a great start for a monolith split. Other question : I saw some presentations on DDD and saw comments from you mentioning it, is there a correlation between splitting in domains in DDD and in services for SOA I have hard time making a relation between the two maybe there is no relations between these concepts. Anyway thank you for doing this video :)

- How do we deal with keeping models in sync across services?
- Are too many shared models an indicator that the split was bad?
- How is DDD related to SOA?
